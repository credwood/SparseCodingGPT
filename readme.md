## Autoregressive Transformer visualization via dictionary learning 

This is a reimplementation of [this](https://github.com/zeyuyun1/TransformerVis/blob/main/readme.md) project based on this paper [Transformer visualization via dictionary learning: contextualized embedding as a linear superposition of transformer factors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15949.pdf) by by Zeyu Yun*, Yubei Chen*, Bruno A Olshausen, and Yann LeCun.
